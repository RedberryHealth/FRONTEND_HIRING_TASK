# **Task: Senior Next.js Developer Assessment**

### **Objective**

Build a simplified e-commerce product application using **Next.js** within 24 hours. The application should focus on the main features, showcasing skills in authentication, API integration, state management, UI design, SSR/SSG, error handling, and SEO optimization.

### **Mandatory Tasks (24-Hour Core Features)**

   * Ensure that users cannot access certain pages without being authenticated.
   * Duration: **4 - 6 hours**
2. **Product API Integration**
   * Build a simple product API using Next.js API routes with CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for products.
   * Integrate the API with the frontend to display a product list and allow for product management (adding, editing, deleting).
   * Duration: **4 - 6 hours**
3. **Global State Management (Redux)**
   * Use Redux for state management to handle global state, including user authentication status and product data.
   * Demonstrate asynchronous data handling (e.g., API calls) using Redux Thunk or Redux Saga.
   * Duration: **3 - 4 hours**
4. **UI/UX Design**
   * Create a responsive product page layout with a clean design.
   * Ensure good user experience on different devices, focusing on responsiveness and usability.
   * Duration: **3 - 4 hours**
5. **SSR and SSG**
   * Implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) for product detail pages.
   * Use Static Site Generation (SSG) for static pages (e.g., homepage, product listing) to improve performance.
   * Duration: **3 - 4 hours**
6. **Error Handling**
   * Handle errors gracefully, both on the frontend (UI feedback for users) and in API routes (proper error responses).
   * Display error messages on invalid API requests or form submissions.
   * Duration: **2 - 3 hours**
7. **SEO Optimization**
   * Add proper SEO optimizations including meta tags, dynamic title and description based on product data, and structured data.
   * Ensure pages are SEO-friendly with correct URL structures.
   * Duration: **2 - 3 hours**

### **Bonus Tasks (Optional Challenges)**

1. **Map Integration**
   * Integrate a map (e.g., Google Maps or OpenStreetMap) that allows users to select their location during the product order process.
   * Implement location-based features like a store locator or delivery address selection.
   * Bonus: **3 - 4 hours**
2. **Image Optimization**
   * Implement optimized image handling using `next/image` to enhance page loading performance.
   * Ensure responsive images are properly displayed at different sizes based on the device.
   * Bonus: **1 - 2 hours**
3. **Advanced Error Handling**
   * Implement custom error pages (e.g., 404, 500) to handle unexpected errors gracefully.
   * Bonus: **1 hour**
4. **Performance Optimization**
   * Apply performance optimizations such as lazy loading of components and dynamic imports for improving loading times.
   * Bonus: **2 - 3 hours**
5. **Product Search and Filtering**
   * Add product search and filtering functionality on the product listing page.
   * Enable users to filter products by category, price range, etc.
   * Bonus: **2 - 3 hours**
