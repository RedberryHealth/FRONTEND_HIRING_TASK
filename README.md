### **Estimated Total Time** : **90 - 130 hours**

This estimation assumes the developer has a moderate level of experience with Next.js and the related technologies (Redux, JWT, APIs, SEO). The timeframe will vary depending on the actual implementation and potential complexities encountered during development.

### **Factors that Influence Time** :

1. **Developer Experience** : Less experienced developers will need more time for each task, particularly with advanced features like JWT refresh tokens, complex state management, or SEO optimizations.
2. **Testing and Debugging** : Proper testing, bug fixes, and edge-case handling could add significant time to the estimate.
3. **External Dependencies** : Integration with third-party APIs or maps (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap) could require more time based on API documentation and error handling.
4. **Feature Complexity** : Features like JWT with refresh tokens or map integration can have many edge cases that could increase the time required.

If more advanced features are included, such as custom middleware for security, complex real-time features, or deep performance optimizations, the time estimate could extend beyond the suggested range.

I'll break the code into relevant sections for both the backend (API routes) and the frontend (Next.js pages).

### 1. **Authentication (JWT)**

#### Backend - `api/auth.js`

```javascript
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';

let users = [{ id: 1, username: 'testuser', password: bcrypt.hashSync('password', 8) }]; // Simulated DB
const SECRET = 'your_jwt_secret'; // Move to .env in production
const REFRESH_SECRET = 'your_refresh_jwt_secret';

export default function handler(req, res) {
    const { method } = req;
    switch (method) {
        case 'POST':
            const { username, password } = req.body;
            const user = users.find(u => u.username === username);
            if (user && bcrypt.compareSync(password, user.password)) {
                const token = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, SECRET, { expiresIn: '15m' });
                const refreshToken = jwt.sign({ id: user.id }, REFRESH_SECRET, { expiresIn: '7d' });
                res.json({ token, refreshToken });
            } else {
                res.status(401).json({ message: 'Invalid credentials' });
            }
            break;
        default:
            res.setHeader('Allow', ['POST']);
            res.status(405).end(`Method ${method} Not Allowed`);
    }
}
```

#### Frontend - `pages/login.js`

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { login } from '../redux/authSlice';

export default function LoginPage() {
    const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
    const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    const handleLogin = async (e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        const response = await fetch('/api/auth', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
        });
        const data = await response.json();
        if (response.ok) {
            dispatch(login({ token: data.token, refreshToken: data.refreshToken }));
        } else {
            alert(data.message);
        }
    };

    return (
        <span class="xml"><form onSubmit={handleLogin}>
            <input value={username} onChange={(e) => setUsername(e.target.value)} placeholder="Username" />
            <input type="password" value={password} onChange={(e) => setPassword(e.target.value)} placeholder="Password" />
            <button type="submit">Login</button>
        </form></span>
    );
}
```

### 2. **API Integration for Products**

#### Backend - `api/products.js`

```javascript
let products = [];

export default function handler(req, res) {
    const { method } = req;
    switch (method) {
        case 'GET':
            res.status(200).json(products);
            break;
        case 'POST':
            const { name, description, price } = req.body;
            const newProduct = { id: products.length + 1, name, description, price };
            products.push(newProduct);
            res.status(201).json(newProduct);
            break;
        default:
            res.setHeader('Allow', ['GET', 'POST']);
            res.status(405).end(`Method ${method} Not Allowed`);
    }
}
```

### 3. **Redux Setup**

#### Frontend - `redux/store.js`

```javascript
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import authReducer from './authSlice';
import productReducer from './productSlice';

export const store = configureStore({
    reducer: {
        auth: authReducer,
        products: productReducer,
    },
});
```

#### Frontend - `redux/authSlice.js`

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
    token: null,
    refreshToken: null,
    isAuthenticated: false,
};

const authSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'auth',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        login(state, action) {
            state.token = action.payload.token;
            state.refreshToken = action.payload.refreshToken;
            state.isAuthenticated = true;
        },
        logout(state) {
            state.token = null;
            state.refreshToken = null;
            state.isAuthenticated = false;
        },
    },
});

export const { login, logout } = authSlice.actions;
export default authSlice.reducer;
```

#### Frontend - `redux/productSlice.js`

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const initialState = {
    products: [],
};

const productSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'products',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        setProducts(state, action) {
            state.products = action.payload;
        },
    },
});

export const { setProducts } = productSlice.actions;
export default productSlice.reducer;
```

### 4. **UI/UX Design for Product Pages**

#### Frontend - `pages/products.js`

```javascript
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { setProducts } from '../redux/productSlice';

export default function ProductsPage() {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const products = useSelector(state => state.products.products);

    useEffect(() => {
        async function fetchProducts() {
            const res = await fetch('/api/products');
            const data = await res.json();
            dispatch(setProducts(data));
        }
        fetchProducts();
    }, [dispatch]);

    return (
        <span class="xml"><div>
            <h1>Products</h1>
            <ul>
                {products.map((product) => (
                    <li key={product.id}>
                        <h2>{product.name}</h2>
                        <p>{product.description}</p>
                        <p>${product.price}</p>
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div></span>
    );
}
```

### 5. **SSR and SSG**

#### Frontend - `pages/product/[id].js`

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
    const { id } = context.params;
    const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/products/${id}`);
    const product = await res.json();

    return {
        props: { product },
    };
}

export default function ProductDetailPage({ product }) {
    return (
        <span class="xml"><div>
            <h1>{product.name}</h1>
            <p>{product.description}</p>
            <p>${product.price}</p>
        </div></span>
    );
}
```

### 6. **Error Handling**

#### Frontend - `pages/products.js` (Updated)

```javascript
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
import { setProducts } from '../redux/productSlice';

export default function ProductsPage() {
    const [error, setError] = useState(null);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const products = useSelector(state => state.products.products);

    useEffect(() => {
        async function fetchProducts() {
            try {
                const res = await fetch('/api/products');
                if (!res.ok) throw new Error('Failed to fetch products');
                const data = await res.json();
                dispatch(setProducts(data));
            } catch (err) {
                setError(err.message);
            }
        }
        fetchProducts();
    }, [dispatch]);

    if (error) return <span class="xml"><p>{error}</p></span>;

    return (
        <span class="xml"><div>
            <h1>Products</h1>
            <ul>
                {products.map((product) => (
                    <li key={product.id}>
                        <h2>{product.name}</h2>
                        <p>{product.description}</p>
                        <p>${product.price}</p>
                    </li>
                ))}
            </ul>
        </div></span>
    );
}
```

### 7. **SEO Optimization**

#### Frontend - `pages/products.js` (Updated)

```javascript
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function ProductsPage() {
    return (
        <span class="xml"><>
            <Head>
                <title>Products - My Store</title>
                <meta name="description" content="Browse our product catalog." />
            </Head>
            <h1>Products</h1>
            {/* Render products */}
        </></span>
    );
}
```

### Setting Up the App

1. **Install dependencies** :

```bash
npm install next react react-dom redux @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux jwt bcryptjs
```

1. **Create `.env.local`** for secrets:
   ```bash
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_refresh_jwt_secret
   ```
2. **Run the app** :

```bash
npm run dev
```

This covers the essential features such as JWT auth, API integration, SSR/SSG, state management, and SEO optimizations within the 24-hour scope.

## A complete implementation of `getServerSideProps` for a detailed product page.

### **SSR (Server-Side Rendering) Implementation**

The `getServerSideProps` function is used to fetch the product data for a single product at the time the page is requested. Here's the complete implementation:

#### Backend - Updated `api/products/[id].js`

To fetch a specific product by ID, the API route needs to be modified.

```javascript
let products = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Product 1', description: 'Description of product 1', price: 10 },
    { id: 2, name: 'Product 2', description: 'Description of product 2', price: 20 },
];

export default function handler(req, res) {
    const { method, query } = req;
    const { id } = query;

    switch (method) {
        case 'GET':
            const product = products.find(p => p.id === parseInt(id));
            if (product) {
                res.status(200).json(product);
            } else {
                res.status(404).json({ message: 'Product not found' });
            }
            break;
        default:
            res.setHeader('Allow', ['GET']);
            res.status(405).end(`Method ${method} Not Allowed`);
    }
}
```

### Frontend - `pages/product/[id].js`

Now, the frontend page will use `getServerSideProps` to fetch the product data from the server.

```javascript
import Head from 'next/head';

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
    const { id } = context.params;
    const res = await fetch(`http://localhost:3000/api/products/${id}`);
    const product = await res.json();

    if (!res.ok) {
        return {
            notFound: true,  // Show 404 page if product not found
        };
    }

    return {
        props: { product }, // Will be passed to the page component as props
    };
}

export default function ProductDetailPage({ product }) {
    return (
        <span class="xml"><>
            <Head>
                <title>{product.name} - My Store</title>
                <meta name="description" content={product.description} />
            </Head>
            <div>
                <h1>{product.name}</h1>
                <p>{product.description}</p>
                <p>${product.price}</p>
            </div>
        </></span>
    );
}
```

### Explanation:

* `getServerSideProps` is executed on each request, ensuring that the page is always rendered with the latest data for the given `id`.
* If the product is not found, it returns `notFound: true`, which triggers a 404 page.
* The fetched product data is passed as props to the page, allowing you to render the product details on the server side.

### Folder Structure

Here’s the relevant file structure to place everything together:

```bash
/pages
  /api
    /products
      [id].js
    auth.js
  /product
    [id].js
  products.js
/redux
  authSlice.js
  productSlice.js
  store.js
.env.local
```

This is the core structure to support both server-side rendering for individual products and a dynamic product list. Let me know if you need more clarification!

## **Use Maps to Send Location Bonus**

**Bonus Task:** Add a feature to select a location using a map and send it to the server.

#### Frontend - `components/MapComponent.js`

We'll use the `react-leaflet` library for the map integration.

1. **Install the required packages:**

```bash
npm install react-leaflet leaflet
```

1. **MapComponent.js:**

```javascript
import { MapContainer, TileLayer, Marker, Popup, useMapEvents } from 'react-leaflet';
import { useState } from 'react';
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';

function LocationMarker({ onLocationChange }) {
    const [position, setPosition] = useState(null);

    useMapEvents({
        click(e) {
            setPosition(e.latlng);
            onLocationChange(e.latlng);
        },
    });

    return position === null ? null : (
        <span class="xml"><Marker position={position}>
            <Popup>Selected location: {position.lat.toFixed(2)}, {position.lng.toFixed(2)}</Popup>
        </Marker></span>
    );
}

export default function MapComponent({ onLocationChange }) {
    return (
        <span class="xml"><MapContainer center={[51.505, -0.09]} zoom={13} style={{ height: '500px', width: '100%' }}>
            <TileLayer
                url="https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png"
                attribution='© <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
            />
            <LocationMarker onLocationChange={onLocationChange} />
        </MapContainer></span>
    );
}
```

#### Frontend - `pages/location.js`

Use the `MapComponent` to allow users to select a location and submit it.

```javascript
import { useState } from 'react';
import MapComponent from '../components/MapComponent';

export default function LocationPage() {
    const [location, setLocation] = useState(null);

    const handleLocationChange = (latlng) => {
        setLocation(latlng);
    };

    const handleSubmit = async () => {
        if (!location) return;

        const res = await fetch('/api/location', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(location),
        });

        const data = await res.json();
        if (res.ok) {
            alert('Location submitted successfully!');
        } else {
            alert('Failed to submit location: ' + data.message);
        }
    };

    return (
        <span class="xml"><div>
            <h1>Select Location</h1>
            <MapComponent onLocationChange={handleLocationChange} />
            <button onClick={handleSubmit} disabled={!location}>Submit Location</button>
        </div></span>
    );
}
```

#### Backend - `api/location.js`

Handle location submissions on the server side.

```javascript
export default function handler(req, res) {
    if (req.method === 'POST') {
        const { lat, lng } = req.body;

        // Here you could save the location to a database or perform other actions
        console.log(`Location received: Latitude ${lat}, Longitude ${lng}`);

        res.status(200).json({ message: 'Location received successfully' });
    } else {
        res.setHeader('Allow', ['POST']);
        res.status(405).end(`Method ${req.method} Not Allowed`);
    }
}
```

### **2. Redux State Management**

**Bonus Task:** Utilize Redux for global state management.

We’ve already covered the basics of Redux in the previous response, but here's how to extend it:

#### Frontend - `redux/store.js`

Already provided earlier.

#### Frontend - `redux/actions.js`

Define actions to handle locations (example):

```javascript
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

const locationSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'location',
    initialState: null,
    reducers: {
        setLocation(state, action) {
            return action.payload;
        },
    },
});

export const { setLocation } = locationSlice.actions;
export default locationSlice.reducer;
```

#### Frontend - `pages/location.js` (Updated)

Include Redux actions in the location page:

```javascript

```

### **3. Use .env for Configuration**

**Bonus Task:** Ensure environment variables are used.

#### `.env.local`

Define your secrets and configuration settings.

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_API_KEY=your_map_api_key
```

Use these variables in your code:

#### Frontend - `components/MapComponent.js`

```bash
const MAP_API_KEY = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_MAP_API_KEY;
```

### **Combining All Features**

Make sure your `pages` and `components` directories are set up properly to handle these functionalities. Ensure that all imports and paths are correct, and you should be able to test and deploy the application with these bonus features integrated.

## Is redux a good idea to be used with next or it is not nesscesarly

Using Redux with Next.js can be a good idea, but whether it’s necessary depends on the complexity and needs of your application. Here’s a breakdown to help you decide:

### **When to Use Redux with Next.js**

1. **Complex State Management** : If your application has complex state that needs to be shared across many components or pages, Redux can help manage this state efficiently.
2. **Global State** : For features like authentication status, user settings, or global UI states that need to be accessible across various parts of the application, Redux is a powerful tool.
3. **Predictable State Management** : Redux provides a predictable way to manage state through actions and reducers, which can be beneficial for debugging and maintaining complex state logic.
4. **Server-Side Data Fetching** : If you need to manage state from server-side data fetching (e.g., `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`), Redux can help integrate this data into your global state.

### **When Redux Might Not Be Necessary**

1. **Simple State Management** : For simple applications where state management is straightforward and doesn’t involve complex interactions or global state, Next.js's built-in features like `useState` and `useContext` might be sufficient.
2. **Server-Side Rendering** : Next.js's server-side rendering capabilities (like `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`) can handle data fetching and state management without the need for Redux. You can directly pass data as props to components.
3. **Performance Concerns** : Redux adds boilerplate and can affect performance if not used properly. For smaller or simpler applications, the overhead might not be justified.

### **Alternatives to Redux**

1. **React Context API** : For managing simple global state, the React Context API is often easier to set up and use compared to Redux. It integrates well with Next.js and is built into React.
2. **React Query** : If your primary need is for server state management (e.g., fetching data from APIs), React Query can be an excellent choice. It provides powerful caching, synchronization, and background data fetching features.
3. **Recoil** : Another state management library for React that is less verbose than Redux and provides a more modern approach to managing state.

### **Example Setup with Redux**

If you decide to use Redux, here’s a basic setup with Next.js:

1. **Install Redux Packages**

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

1. **Create Redux Store**

```javascript
// redux/store.js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import rootReducer from './rootReducer'; // Combine your reducers here

const store = configureStore({
    reducer: rootReducer,
});

export default store;
```

1. **Integrate Redux with Next.js**

```javascript
// pages/_app.js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from '../redux/store';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
    return (
        <span class="xml"><Provider store={store}>
            <Component {...pageProps} />
        </Provider></span>
    );
}

export default MyApp;
```

1. **Use Redux in Components**

```javascript
// ExampleComponent.js
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { someAction } from '../redux/someSlice';

const ExampleComponent = () => {
    const state = useSelector((state) => state.someState);
    const dispatch = useDispatch();

    const handleClick = () => {
        dispatch(someAction());
    };

    return (
        <span class="xml"><div>
            <button onClick={handleClick}>Do Action</button>
            <p>{state.value}</p>
        </div></span>
    );
};

export default ExampleComponent;
```

### **Conclusion**

Redux is a powerful tool but is best used for complex applications where global state management and predictability are critical. For simpler applications or those with straightforward state management needs, alternatives like React Context or React Query may be more appropriate and easier to integrate with Next.js.
